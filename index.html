      You are my laughter, my calm, my heart. Every moment with you is magic. I promise to be yours forever. ✨
      I don’t know if words will ever be enough to explain what you mean to me, but I still want to try—because you deserve to hear it again and again.

From the moment you came into my life, everything felt a little warmer, a little calmer, and a lot more beautiful. You have this way of making even ordinary moments feel special, simply by being you. Your smile feels like home to me, and your presence gives me a comfort I never knew I needed.

I love how you understand me, even when I don’t say much. I love how you support me, encourage me, and believe in me—sometimes more than I believe in myself. With you, I feel seen, valued, and deeply cared for.

You are not just someone I love; you are someone I choose—every single day. Through happy moments, difficult days, laughter, and silence, my heart keeps choosing you. I’m grateful for your patience, your kindness, and the love you give so effortlessly.

Thank you for being my safe place, my happiness, and my favorite person. No matter where life takes us, I want you to know that my heart is always with you.

Forever yours,
❤️
